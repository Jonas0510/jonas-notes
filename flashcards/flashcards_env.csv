What is the primary purpose of coagulation in water treatment?,"To destabilise colloidal particles by adding chemicals (coagulants) to neutralise their negative charge, allowing them to aggregate."
How does flocculation differ from coagulation in water treatment?,"Flocculation is a slow mixing process that encourages destabilised particles to collide and form larger flocs, whereas coagulation is a fast mixing process for chemical dispersion."
"In coagulation, what is the mechanism of 'Diffuse Layer Compression'?","High ionic strength in the water compresses the electrical double layer around a particle, which lowers the repulsive energy barrier between particles."
What is the 'Charge Neutralisation' mechanism in coagulation?,"Positively charged coagulant ions, such as $Al^{3+}$ or $Fe^{3+}$, adsorb onto negatively charged dirt particles, neutralising their surface charge."
Describe the 'Sweep Flocculation' mechanism of coagulation.,"A high dose of coagulant forms a metal hydroxide precipitate, like $Al(OH)_3$, which physically 'sweeps' colloidal particles down as it settles."
What is the 'Inter-particle Bridging' mechanism in coagulation?,"Long polymer chains attach to multiple colloidal particles simultaneously, bridging them together like a net to form larger aggregates."
"In coagulation, what is 're-stabilisation' and what causes it?","Re-stabilisation occurs when an overdose of coagulant makes the particles become positively charged, causing them to repel each other again and preventing floc formation."
What is the purpose of 'Tapered Flocculation'?,It uses a series of tanks with decreasing mixing intensity (G) to build large flocs initially (high G) and then prevent them from shearing apart before settling (low G).
What is the primary objective of a Jar Test in water treatment?,To determine the optimum coagulant dose and pH for effective turbidity removal.
"In a Jar Test, what does the typical graph of Turbidity vs. Coagulant Dose look like?","It is a U-shaped curve, where turbidity is high at low and high (overdose) doses, and at a minimum at the optimum dose."
How do coagulants like Alum or Ferric Chloride affect water chemistry?,They produce $H^+$ ions (acid) and consume the water's alkalinity (buffering capacity).
What must be done if a water source has insufficient alkalinity for coagulation with alum?,"A supplementary chemical, such as Lime or Soda Ash, must be added to provide the necessary alkalinity for the reaction to proceed."
"What is the formula for the mean velocity gradient, $G$, in a flocculation tank?","The formula is $G = \sqrt{\frac{P}{\mu V}}$, where P is power, $\mu$ is dynamic viscosity, and V is volume."

"In settling, what defines Type I or Discrete Settling?","Particles settle individually without interacting, and their physical properties (size, shape, density) remain constant during settling."
What is Type II or Flocculent Settling?,"Particles collide and aggregate (flocculate) as they settle, causing them to increase in size and settle faster with depth."
Describe Type III or Hindered (Zone) Settling.,"This occurs at high particle concentrations where particles are so close they hinder each other, settling as a 'blanket' with a clear interface above."
What is Type IV or Compression Settling?,"Occurs at very high concentrations where particles are in physical contact, and settling only occurs as the weight of particles squeezes out water from the sludge mass."
What is the Surface Overflow Rate ($v_0$) in a settling tank?,"It is the design parameter calculated as Flow Rate ($Q$) divided by Surface Area ($A$), representing the upward velocity of the water."

"What is the formula for Stokes' Law, used to calculate the settling velocity ($v_s$) of a discrete particle?","$v_s = \frac{g(S - 1)d^2}{18\nu}$, where g is gravity, S is specific gravity, d is particle diameter, and $\nu$ is kinematic viscosity."
Why is it a crucial step to check the Reynolds Number (Re) after calculating settling velocity with Stokes' Law?,"Stokes' Law is only valid for laminar flow conditions, where $Re < 1$, so the check is required to validate the calculation."
How does Stokes' Law explain the benefit of coagulation and flocculation?,"Settling velocity ($v_s$) is proportional to the square of the particle diameter ($d^2$), so increasing particle size through flocculation drastically increases settling speed."
Compare the removal of slow-settling particles ($v_s < v_0$) in horizontal flow vs. upflow clarifiers.,"Horizontal flow clarifiers achieve partial removal of slow particles, while upflow clarifiers achieve zero removal as these particles are carried out with the upward flow."
What is the main problem with using a single media sand filter that dual media filters solve?,"After backwashing, sand stratifies with the smallest grains on top, causing rapid surface blinding and inefficient use of the filter bed depth."
"In a dual media filter, why is anthracite placed on top of the sand?","Anthracite has larger particles but a lower density than sand, so after backwashing it naturally settles back on top of the denser sand layer."
What is the primary benefit of 'depth filtration' achieved by dual media filters?,"Larger particles are trapped in the coarse top layer (anthracite) and smaller particles are trapped in the finer bottom layer (sand), utilising the entire bed depth."
What is 'filter ripening'?,"It is the initial period after backwashing where the filter is 'too clean' and efficiency is low, until some particles attach to the media and improve its collection ability."
List the three criteria that can trigger the need to backwash a filter.,"1. Headloss reaches a maximum limit, 2. Breakthrough of turbidity occurs in the effluent, or 3. A maximum time limit is reached."
The Fair-Hatch equation for headloss ($h_L$) in a filter bed includes the term $\Sigma(\frac{P_i}{d_i^2})$. What do $P_i$ and $d_i$ represent?,"$P_i$ is the mass fraction of particles retained between two sieves, and $d_i$ is the geometric mean diameter of those particles."

What is a major disadvantage of a single-feed DMA in terms of resilience?,"If the single inlet pipe fails, the entire area loses its water supply."
Why is the period between 02:00 and 04:00 am typically used to measure Minimum Night Flow (MNF) for leakage detection?,"Because legitimate customer water consumption is at its lowest and most stable during this period, making any significant flow likely to be from leakage."
"The relationship between leakage flow rate ($Q_{leak}$) and pressure (P) is described by the FAVOUR equation, $Q_{leak} \propto P^{N1}$. What does this imply?","It implies that reducing pressure can significantly reduce leakage flow rate, especially for plastic pipes where the exponent N1 is often greater than 1."
"Besides reducing leakage flow rate, what is another key benefit of pressure management in a water network?","It reduces the frequency of new bursts by minimising pressure transients (surges) that stress the pipes, thereby extending asset life."
